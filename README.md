## Overview

MinorMap Plus is a smart web-based platform designed to help students discover and choose the most suitable **minor specialisation** based on their interests, strengths, career goals, and academic background. Instead of blindly selecting a minor, students receive data-driven recommendations through an intuitive and guided experience.

This project bridges the gap between confusion and clarity in academic decision-making.
